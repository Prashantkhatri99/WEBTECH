        <h1>GOD OF WAR</h1>
        <img src="img/god of war.jpeg" width="100%">
        <p>Starting with the release of God of War in 2005 on PlayStation 2, Santa Monica Studio has created seven games across multiple platforms up to the most recent release in 2018.

            Now comes the sequel to the critically acclaimed God of War (2018), God of War Ragnarök.
            
            Join Kratos and Atreus on a mythic journey for answers before Ragnarök arrives. Together, father and son must put everything on the line as they journey to each of the Nine Realms. Throughout stunning mythological landscapes, they’ll face fearsome enemies – from Norse gods to wild beasts – as they prepare for the showdown of their lives.       
            
            Armed with his trusty weapons of war – including the Leviathan Axe and the Blades of Chaos – Kratos’ deadly skills will be tested like never before as he fights to protect his family. A host of new abilities for him and Atreus also await, leaving room for fluid, expressive and customizable combat in this epic and unflinching tale.   
            
            All the while, Asgardian forces assemble…
